# Weztech Demo Website

Weztech is a live-music gear servicing business that specialises in guitars where anyone from experienced musicians to casual music enthusiasts are provided with personalised advice, repairs and builds to give them the freedom to express their music to the fullest.



## Description

Weztech is a family owned guitar and amplifier servicing shop run by Wesley Zagorc in Mitcham, Victoria. Established in late 2016, Wesley uses the skills and passion he has gained through his extensive history with guitars and the live music industry to deliver an individualised servicing experience to his clients. As a business, Weztech is primarily focused on providing customers with guitar setups, guitar modifications, guitar repairs and related electronics inspections/service. Under the umbrella of Weztechâ€™s operations, there are also guitar lessons that Wesley runs himself and future aspirations for Weztech to engineer their own musical equipment and instruments.

### Executing program

## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and setup the 
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
